## 🎯 Two Ways to Build This

### Option 1: Use Replit AI (Easiest)
1. Open `replit_prompt.md`
2. Copy the entire prompt
3. Paste into Replit AI
4. Let it build the full application
5. Add your API credentials
6. Deploy!

**Time:** ~2 hours (mostly AI building)
**Difficulty:** Easy - just guide the AI

### Option 2: Build From Starter Code (More Control)
1. Use the example code in `starter_code/`
2. Extend it to add:
   - Web dashboard
   - Database for storing automations
   - Background job scheduler
3. Deploy to Replit

**Time:** ~8-12 hours
**Difficulty:** Intermediate Python/Web dev

## 📝 Sample Automation

```python
{
  "name": "Price Inquiry Auto-Response",
  "platform": "instagram",
  "trigger": {
    "keywords": ["price", "cost", "how much"],
    "match_type": "contains",
    "case_sensitive": False
  },
  "action": {
    "type": "send_dm",
    "message_template": """
      Hey {username}! 👋
      
      Thanks for asking about pricing!
      
      Our products range from $29-99 depending on the package.

    """,
    "delay_minutes": 2
  },
  "rules": {

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Meta App Review (Instagram/Facebook)
- **Required** for production use
- Takes 3-7 days
- ~90% approval rate if legitimate
- Can test in Development Mode meanwhile

### YouTube Quotas
- 10,000 units/day FREE
- Each reply costs 50 units
- = 200 replies/day free
- Request increase if needed (also free!)

### Rate Limits
- Instagram: ~200 requests/hour
- Facebook: Similar limits
- YouTube: Quota-based (not rate limited)
- Build in queue system to stay safe

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**"Invalid OAuth token"**
→ Token expired, regenerate from Meta Developer Console

**"Insufficient permissions"**
→ Submit app for Meta review, or add permission in settings

**"YouTube quota exceeded"**
→ Reduce polling frequency or request quota increase

**"Can't send DM on Instagram"**
→ User must message you first OR be following you (with proper permissions)

**"Replit keeps going to sleep"**
→ Upgrade to Hacker plan or use UptimeRobot to ping every 5 mins

3. **Monitor Closely**: Watch for API errors first few days
4. **Add Delays**: Make responses appear human-like
5. **Vary Messages**: Use multiple response templates
6. **Cache Heavily**: Reduce API calls where possible
7. **Log Everything**: You'll thank yourself when debugging
